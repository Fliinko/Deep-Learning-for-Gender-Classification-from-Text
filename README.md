# Deep-Learning-for-Gender-Classification-from-Text 
## LLT3510 University of Malta

The structure of this project (submitted for fulfillment of the assignment component of LLT3510) is based on 3 steps.
### 1) Preprocessing the Datasets
    Setting up into Training and Testing sets with X and Y correspondents 
    Tokenization 

### 2) Creating a Linear Regression Model 
    Creating a Linear Regression Model to classify the sentence gender label 
    An additional task was to find the top 10 words in the whole dataset

### 3) Creating a Deep Learning Model 
    A RNN was opted to be used instead of a CNN due to better performance historically in RNNs when it comes to text processing 
    
All of the code can be found in the text_classification Jupyter Notebook, whereas the datasets can be found as the only CSVs in the repository
